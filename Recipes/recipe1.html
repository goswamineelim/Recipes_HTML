    <p><strong>Description : </strong> Biryani is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat. Sometimes eggs and/or potatoes are also added.</p>

    <strong>Recipe : </strong>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, marinate the chicken with ginger-garlic paste, 2 tbsp salt, 2 tbsp red chili powder, 2 tbsp biryani masala, yogurt, and lemon juice. Mix well and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat oil and ghee over medium-high heat. Add cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, bay leaves, and peppercorns and fry for a few seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions and fry until golden brown, stirring occasionally. Remove half of the fried onions and set aside for later.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated chicken and its marinade to the same pot and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and cook, covered, for 20 to 25 minutes or until the chicken is almost done. Turn off the heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>In another large pot, bring 5 liters of water to a boil. Add the remaining salt, red chili powder, and biryani masala and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked rice and cook until the rice is 80% done, about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and grease a large baking dish.</li>
        <li>To assemble the biryani, spread half of the rice in an even layer at the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle half of the fried onions, mint leaves, and cilantro leaves over the rice. Arrange the chicken pieces and the gravy over the rice. Cover with the remaining rice and sprinkle the rest of the fried onions, mint leaves, and cilantro leaves. Drizzle some food color over the rice if using.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until the rice and chicken are fully cooked and the flavors are well combined.</li>
        <li>Garnish with boiled eggs and fried potatoes if desired and serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) and salad. Enjoy!</li>
